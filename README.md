# foundations-landing-page
Landing page project from The Odin Project

The purpose of this project is to use mainly CSS flexbox to create a 4-section landing page (plus a footer).

The initial build will use dummy content to practice flexbox properties and better understand how they work. The finished page will be customized and hosted for viewing.
